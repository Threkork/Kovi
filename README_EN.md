# Kovi

Kovi is a plugin framework for OneBot V11. If you want to develop OneBot V11 bots using Rust, Kovi is a great choice.

🎯 The goal is to create the simplest OneBot framework in Rust! Simplifying complex Rust syntax? Kovi has done its best.

🤔 Let me count, the quick start in the documentation only requires 15 lines of code to create and run the simplest plugin.

🥁 There’s also a CLI tool to make project development easier.

🛍️ The plugin store provides an excellent Kovi shopping experience, allowing you to easily access packages from plugin developers 📦.

😍 The project documentation is very simple and easy to understand. Follow it and you’ll be good to go.
